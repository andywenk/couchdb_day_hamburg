There will be breakfast starting at 9.00 and there will be also lunch catered for you.

In the evening we'll have a party with free softdrinks and beer. The location is still secret, but you can bring your friends and also laundry with you :)

The day after the CouchDB Day we'll have a nodeschool happening in Hamburg! If you want to participate, they are still searching attendees and mentors: http://nodeschool.io/hamburg/

Never been to Hamburg? Our friends from the JS Unconf have some tips regarding public transport and sightseeing for your trip! http://2015.jsunconf.eu/news/hamburg-first-visit/

If you have friends that can't afford the travel we'll help them together with the fine folks from Hoodie! <<LINK>>
