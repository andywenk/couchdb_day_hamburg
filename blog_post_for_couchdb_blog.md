# CouchDB Day Hamburg 2015

CouchDB is fascinating. Not only because CouchDB is a cool NoSQL database with cool features, but also because it's community is so awesome. 

##The idea

One month ago my fellow CouchDB friend Robert Kowalski came up with the idea, to create a CouchDB Day. I liked the idea from the beginning and asked him, if he needs help and if he would like me to join the organisation team. Well, yesterday we announced the date and location:

CouchDB Day 2015  
February 7th  
at SinnerSchrader Hamburg, Germany  

It was amazing how fast this grew. First we were just blown away by the super awesome feedback from the community. The CouchDB PMC helped us with many information regarding trademarks and had many cool ideas. So we created a little [website for the CouchDB Day](http://day.couchdb.org). 

##Sponsors

After just two days we already had the sponsors [sum.cumo](http://sumcumo.com) and [Ubilabs](http://ubilabs.net) on board. That was quick. And finally after just one call and two emails with Holger Blank, we found the location at [SinnerSchrader](http://www.sinnerschrader.com). They will also spend the drinks for the day. Thank you so much! You rock ...

Well, with sponsor money, some financial and tax issues arise. Luckily and as of today, we also fixed that. sum.cumo will take this part and we are extremely happy to welcome sum.cumo as co-organiser.

##Interested CouchDB folks

Another awesome fact was the interestd of the community. We created a little ticket site at [Tito](https://ti.to/andywenk/couchdbday-hamburg-2015) and after just two days, there were already 20 interested people. Without knowing a date, a location or even a schedule for the day. Wow. (Side note: a big thank you goes out to Doc at Tito. The support is extremely awesome and you should really check out [Tito](https://ti.to/home). This service is brilliant).

##Tickets available - FOR FREE

In 1969 one of the organisers of the Woodstock Festival announced "This is a free concert from now on" even though he knew, that he is ruined. We will not be ruined, but we decided to make this a FREE event. The CouchDB community exists because there are many many volunteers spending their time, ideas and enthusiasm to create an awesome piece of software. We want to give back a little bit. So up from Wednesday, November 5th 10:00 am CET, the tickets are available at our [ticket website](https://ti.to/andywenk/couchdbday-hamburg-2015). Go grab your ticket - now! :)

##The Day 

The idea of the CouchDB Day is bringing interested people to one place and do something awesome with CouchDB. We will have three short talks. The rest of the day will be "hands on". We will propose some groups the attendees can join. These are for now:

* CouchDB Core (Erlang)
* Fauxton
* Use CouchDB
* Couchapps and Hoodie
* The CouchDB Community

With this we hope, that all folks can find a place where they like to be. And as you know - the CouchDB community is always looking for contributors. So check it out and help making this community and software even bigger and more awesome.

And yes we hear you! We will have a place at night where we can meet for drinks and talk ;-).

##The next Day?

This is will be the first CouchDB Day. We are impressed by the interest, help and enthusiasm for this event. Thank you so much. So let's see what we will do in 2016. For now, we are looking forward to February 7th 2015. We would love to see you in our nice and rockin' city of Hamburg.
